## Introduction

I'm a DevOps Engineer with over two years of experience and a degree in Telematics Engineering from PUCMM.
My tech stack includes Go, Python, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and  many more. I have a passion
for building great CLI tools and making Friday deployments as smooth as possible 😁. In my free time I'm probably
reading manga 📚, biking 🚴, or cooking up something fun in Go 👨‍🍳.
